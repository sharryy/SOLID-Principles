Know Just Look at the Refactored Code.
Dependency Inversion States that :

"High-level module should depend upon Abstractions
while low-level module should also depend upon Abstractions
and they both shouldn't depend upon each other.
& Details should depend upon ABSTRACTIONS"

In this piece of code, PASSWORD REMINDER (high-level module)
depends upon CONNECTION INTERFACE (abstraction) while
DBCONNECTION (low-level module) also depends upon
CONNECTION INTERFACE (abstraction). Hence the principle is
not violated.
