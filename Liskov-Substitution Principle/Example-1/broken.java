/*
If we look at this piece of Code, the point where Liskov Substitution
principle is broken is where we introduce different exception in Child
Class. Now we have to separately check if a class is instanceof some
particular type, then handle this exception otherwise handle other exception.
If any other video player is added then we have to add another type-checking.
breaking Open-Closed Principle.
Whenever code breaks LSP, it also breaks OCP (Open-Closed) Principle.
Similarly, the pre-conditions are not matching as well. This is clear
violation of LSP.
