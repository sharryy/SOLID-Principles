/*
In this silly but understandable example, we can see that
human worker needs to work as well needs proper sleep to avoid
exhaustion. But an android worker doesn't need sleep since it is
a machine but according to our design strategy, AndroidWorker class
has to implement sleep() method as respected by the Interface
contract. So this is violation of Interface-Segregation Principle
that a client shouldn't be forced to implement those methods which
is not applicable to him.g
